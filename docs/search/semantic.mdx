# Semantic Search

Find conceptually similar content using AI embeddings.

## How It Works

1. Your query is converted to a vector embedding using OpenAI
2. The embedding is compared against session embeddings
3. Results are ranked by semantic similarity

## Example

Query:

```
how to handle user login
```

Returns sessions about authentication, even if they don't contain those exact words. Results might include discussions about:

- OAuth implementation
- Session management
- JWT tokens
- Password hashing

## Requirements

Semantic search requires:

- OpenAI API key configured
- Embeddings generated for sessions

<Info>
  Embeddings are generated automatically when sessions sync. Older sessions may
  need to be re-indexed.
</Info>

## Using in the Dashboard

1. Go to **Context** in the navigation
2. Enter a natural language question
3. Results show conceptually similar sessions

## Using the API

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-url.convex.site/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "how do I implement authentication",
    "type": "semantic",
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "sessionId": "session_456",
      "title": "OAuth Setup Guide",
      "snippet": "Setting up OAuth with passport.js...",
      "score": 0.89
    }
  ]
}
```

## Embedding Model

OpenSync uses `text-embedding-3-small` by default:

| Model                  | Dimensions | Cost            |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| text-embedding-3-small | 1536       | $0.02/1M tokens |

## Best Practices

<Tip title="Semantic search tips">
  - Ask questions naturally, as you would to a colleague - Be specific about the
  problem or concept - Combine with date filters to find recent solutions
