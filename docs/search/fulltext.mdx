# Full-Text Search

Search across all session content using exact text matching.

## How It Works

Full-text search uses Convex's built-in search indexes to find sessions containing your search terms.

```
authentication middleware express
```

This query returns sessions containing "authentication", "middleware", and "express".

## Search Syntax

### Basic Search

Search for any word:

```
authentication
```

### Multiple Terms

All terms must match (AND):

```
react hooks useState
```

### Phrase Search

Match exact phrases (coming soon):

```
"error handling"
```

## Search Fields

Full-text search indexes the following fields:

| Field          | Description                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| messages       | All user and assistant messages |
| title          | Session title                   |
| searchableText | Combined text from all parts    |

## Using in the Dashboard

1. Go to any sessions list
2. Use the search box at the top
3. Results update in real-time

## Using the API

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-url.convex.site/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "authentication middleware",
    "type": "fulltext",
    "limit": 10
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "sessionId": "session_123",
      "title": "Express Auth Setup",
      "snippet": "...setting up authentication middleware...",
      "score": 0.95
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

<Tip title="Search tips">
  - Use specific, unique terms for better results - Include technical terms
  (function names, libraries) - Combine with source filters for narrower results
