# API Keys

API keys authenticate sync plugins and API requests to your OpenSync instance.

## Generating Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in">Sign in to your OpenSync dashboard</Step>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click your profile icon and select **Settings**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Key">Click **Generate API Key**</Step>
  <Step title="Save securely">
    Copy the key immediately. It won't be shown again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Format

API keys follow the format:

```
osk_[random-alphanumeric-string]
```

Example: `osk_7a8b9c0d1e2f3g4h5i6j7k8l9m0n`

## Using Keys

### In Plugins

When running `plugin-name login`:

```
? Enter your API Key: osk_your_key_here
```

### In API Requests

Include in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer osk_your_key" \
  https://your-url.convex.site/api/sessions
```

## Key Storage

Keys are hashed before storage:

| What       | Where                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Full key   | Shown once on generation         |
| Hashed key | Stored in Convex `apiKeys` table |
| Key prefix | Stored for identification        |

<Info>
  We cannot recover your API key if you lose it. Generate a new one if needed.
</Info>

## Managing Keys

### View Keys

In Settings, see a list of your API keys with:

- Key prefix (first 8 characters)
- Creation date
- Last used date

### Revoke Keys

To revoke a key:

1. Find the key in Settings
2. Click **Revoke**
3. Confirm revocation

Revoked keys immediately stop working.

## Security Best Practices

<Warning title="Security recommendations">
  - Generate separate keys for development and production - Rotate keys
  periodically - Never commit keys to version control - Use environment
  variables to store keys - Revoke keys that may be compromised
</Warning>
