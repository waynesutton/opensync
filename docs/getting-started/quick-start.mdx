## Install Plugin

Install a sync plugin globally on your machine:

<CodeGroup
  tabs={[
    { label: "OpenCode", code: "npm install -g opencode-sync-plugin" },
    { label: "Claude Code", code: "npm install -g claude-code-sync" },
    { label: "Codex CLI", code: "npm install -g codex-sync" },
    { label: "Cursor", code: "npm install -g cursor-sync-plugin" },
  ]}
/>

Then login with your credentials:

```bash
opencode-sync login
# Enter your Convex URL and API key when prompted
```

## Verify Setup

Check that everything is working:

```bash
opencode-sync status
```

You should see:

```
Connected: true
Convex URL: https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
Sessions synced: 0
```

Start coding with OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor and your sessions will sync automatically.
