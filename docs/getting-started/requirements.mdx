# Self-Hosting Requirements

OpenSync can be deployed in two ways: cloud deployment with managed services, or 100% local deployment.

## Cloud Deployment

For standard deployment with cloud services:

| Service                                                        | Purpose                        | Required |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- |
| [Convex](https://convex.dev)                                   | Real-time database and backend | Yes      |
| [WorkOS](https://workos.com)                                   | Authentication (AuthKit)       | Yes      |
| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com)                          | Embeddings for semantic search | Optional |
| [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com) | Frontend hosting               | Yes      |

<Info title="Free tiers available">
  All services have generous free tiers. Convex free tier includes 1M function
  calls/month. WorkOS free tier includes 1M MAUs.
</Info>

## 100% Local Deployment

For air-gapped or privacy-focused deployments:

| Component  | Local Alternative                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Database   | Convex self-hosted (coming soon) or local SQLite |
| Auth       | Local auth provider or disable auth              |
| Embeddings | Local models via Ollama                          |
| Frontend   | Any static server                                |

<Warning title="Local deployment">
  100% local deployment requires additional configuration. See the [Fork &
  Self-Host](/docs#fork) section for details.
</Warning>

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables for cloud deployment:

```bash
# Convex
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud

# WorkOS (for authentication)
WORKOS_API_KEY=sk_...
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_...
WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD=a-32-character-or-longer-secret
