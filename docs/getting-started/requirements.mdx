# Self-Hosting Requirements

OpenSync can run on managed cloud services or on your own infrastructure. This page covers what you need for each approach.

## Cloud deployment

The standard deployment uses these managed services:

| Service | Purpose | Required | Free tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Convex](https://convex.dev) | Real-time database, backend functions, file storage | Yes | 1M function calls/month |
| [WorkOS](https://workos.com) | Authentication via AuthKit (GitHub, Google, email) | Yes | 1M MAUs |
| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) | text-embedding-3-small for semantic search | Optional | Pay-as-you-go |
| [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com) | Static frontend hosting | Yes | Generous free tier |

<Info title="Cost for small teams">
  Most individual developers and small teams will stay within free tiers for Convex, WorkOS, and Netlify. The main variable cost is OpenAI embeddings, which run about $0.02 per 1M tokens. A typical coding session generates roughly 2K-10K tokens of searchable text, so embedding costs are negligible.
</Info>

## What Convex handles

Convex serves as the entire backend for OpenSync. There is no separate server or API layer to deploy. Convex provides:

- **Real-time database** with automatic sync to connected clients
- **Serverless functions** for queries, mutations, and actions
- **HTTP endpoints** for the plugin sync API (`/sync/session`, `/sync/message`, etc.)
- **Full-text search** indexes for keyword search across sessions
- **Vector search** indexes for semantic search with 1536-dimension OpenAI embeddings
- **File storage** for daily wrapped images and profile photos
- **Scheduled functions** for background processing like embedding generation

All backend logic lives in the `convex/` directory of the repository.

## What WorkOS handles

WorkOS AuthKit provides authentication with zero configuration for OAuth providers:

- GitHub sign-in
- Google sign-in
- Email/password sign-in
- Session management and token refresh

WorkOS is configured through environment variables. See the [WorkOS setup guide](/auth/workos) for details.

## 100% Local deployment

For air-gapped environments or developers who want full control:

| Component | Cloud service | Local alternative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database & backend | Convex Cloud | Convex self-hosted (when available) |
| Authentication | WorkOS | Disable auth or use a local provider |
| Embeddings | OpenAI API | Local models via Ollama (nomic-embed-text, etc.) |
| Frontend | Netlify/Vercel | Any static file server (`npx serve dist/`) |

<Warning title="Local deployment is advanced">
  Running fully local requires modifying authentication logic and embedding generation. The codebase assumes Convex Cloud and WorkOS by default. See the [Fork Guide](/fork/guide) for instructions on customizing these components.
</Warning>

## System requirements

For local development:

- **Node.js** 18 or later
- **npm** 9+ or **bun** 1.0+
- **Git** for cloning the repository

No Docker or container runtime is needed. Convex runs as a cloud service and the frontend is a standard Vite/React app.

## Environment variables

All configuration is done through environment variables. Here is the minimum set for a cloud deployment:

```bash
# Frontend (Vite)
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
VITE_WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_...

# Convex backend (set via npx convex env set)
WORKOS_API_KEY=sk_...
WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_...
WORKOS_COOKIE_PASSWORD=a-random-string-at-least-32-characters

# Optional: enables semantic search
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

For the complete list with descriptions, see [Environment Variables](/hosting/env).

## Architecture overview

```
CLI Tool (OpenCode, Claude, Cursor, etc.)
    |
    v
Sync Plugin (npm package, runs locally)
    |
    v  HTTPS POST /sync/session, /sync/message
    |
Convex HTTP Endpoints (convex/http.ts)
    |
    v
Convex Database (sessions, messages, parts, embeddings)
    |
    v
React Dashboard (Vite, served from Netlify/Vercel)
    |
    v
User's browser (real-time subscriptions via Convex client)
```

Plugins authenticate using API keys generated in the dashboard Settings. Each API call includes an `Authorization: Bearer osk_...` header that maps to a user account.
