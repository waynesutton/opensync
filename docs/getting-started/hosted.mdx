# Use the Hosted Version

The fastest way to get started. Sign in at [opensync.dev](https://www.opensync.dev), install a plugin locally, and start syncing in under 2 minutes.

No servers to configure. No databases to provision. The hosted version runs on Convex with WorkOS authentication and handles everything for you.

## Step by step setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to OpenSync">
    Go to [opensync.dev](https://www.opensync.dev) and sign in with GitHub, Google, or email. Your account is created automatically on first sign in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate an API key">
    Open **Settings** from the sidebar and click **Generate API Key**. Copy the key. It starts with `osk_` and is shown only once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install a sync plugin">
    Install the plugin for your tool globally with npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g opencode-sync-plugin   # For OpenCode
    npm install -g claude-code-sync       # For Claude Code
    npm install -g codex-sync             # For Codex CLI
    npm install -g cursor-opensync-plugin # For Cursor
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the login command">
    Each plugin has a `login` command that stores your credentials locally:

    ```bash
    opencode-sync login
    ```

    When prompted, enter:
    - **Convex URL**: `https://polished-penguin-622.convex.cloud`
    - **API Key**: The key you copied from Settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start coding">
    Open your coding tool and start a session. The plugin picks up new sessions automatically and syncs them to your dashboard. You should see your first session appear within seconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info title="Hosted Convex URL">
  The hosted version uses `https://polished-penguin-622.convex.cloud` as the Convex URL. All plugins need this URL during login.
</Info>

## Verify it works

After logging in, run the status command to confirm the connection:

```bash
opencode-sync status
```

You should see output like:

```
Connected: true
Convex URL: https://polished-penguin-622.convex.cloud
Sessions synced: 0
```

Then start a coding session. Open your dashboard at [opensync.dev](https://www.opensync.dev) and the session should appear in the Sessions view.

## What gets synced

Each session includes:

- **Title** auto-generated from the first user message
- **All messages** with role labels (user, assistant, system, tool)
- **Token counts** per message and per session (prompt and completion tokens)
- **Cost estimate** based on published model pricing
- **Model name** and provider
- **Project path** (if available from the tool)
- **Timestamps** for session creation and last update

Message parts are preserved, including text content, tool calls, and code blocks.

## Data and privacy

- Sessions are stored in your personal Convex database partition
- No data is shared between accounts
- WorkOS handles authentication with enterprise-grade security
- You can delete any session or your entire account at any time
- Self-hosting is available if you need full control over the infrastructure
