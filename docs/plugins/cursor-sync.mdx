# Cursor Plugin

Sync your Cursor AI sessions to OpenSync.

## Installation

Install the plugin globally:

```bash
npm install -g cursor-sync-plugin
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn global add cursor-sync-plugin
```

## Configuration

### Login

Connect the plugin to your OpenSync account:

```bash
cursor-sync login
```

You'll be prompted for:

- **Convex URL** - Your OpenSync backend URL
- **API Key** - Your API key from Settings

### Config File

Configuration is stored in `~/.cursor-sync/config.json`:

```json
{
  "convexUrl": "https://your-deployment.convex.cloud",
  "apiKey": "osk_..."
}
```

## Commands

### status

Check connection and sync status:

```bash
cursor-sync status
```

Output:

```
Connected: true
Convex URL: https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
Sessions synced: 67
Last sync: 30 seconds ago
```

### sync

Manually trigger a sync:

```bash
cursor-sync sync
```

### logout

Disconnect and clear credentials:

```bash
cursor-sync logout
```

## How Syncing Works

1. Cursor stores conversation data in its workspace
2. The plugin reads Cursor's agent transcripts
3. Sessions sync to OpenSync with full context
4. Supports all models available in Cursor

## What Gets Synced

| Data         | Included |
| ------------ | -------- |
| Prompts      | Yes      |
| Responses    | Yes      |
| Model used   | Yes      |
| Token counts | Yes      |
| File context | Limited  |
| Tool calls   | Yes      |

<Info>
  File contents referenced in conversations are not synced to protect sensitive
  code.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

### Sessions not syncing

1. Ensure Cursor is closed before syncing
2. Check plugin status: `cursor-sync status`
3. Verify the Cursor data directory is accessible

### Partial sessions

Large sessions may be truncated. This is normal for very long conversations.
