# OpenCode Plugin

Sync your OpenCode sessions to OpenSync automatically.

## Installation

Install the plugin globally:

```bash
npm install -g opencode-sync-plugin
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn global add opencode-sync-plugin
```

## Configuration

### Login

Connect the plugin to your OpenSync account:

```bash
opencode-sync login
```

You'll be prompted for:

- **Convex URL** - Your OpenSync backend URL
- **API Key** - Your API key from Settings

### Config File

Configuration is stored in `~/.opencode-sync/config.json`:

```json
{
  "convexUrl": "https://your-deployment.convex.cloud",
  "apiKey": "osk_..."
}
```

## Commands

### status

Check connection and sync status:

```bash
opencode-sync status
```

Output:

```
Connected: true
Convex URL: https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
Sessions synced: 42
Last sync: 2 minutes ago
```

### sync

Manually trigger a sync:

```bash
opencode-sync sync
```

<Info>
  Sessions sync automatically as you work. Manual sync is rarely needed.
</Info>

### logout

Disconnect and clear credentials:

```bash
opencode-sync logout
```

## How Syncing Works

1. OpenCode writes session data to `~/.opencode/sessions/`
2. The plugin watches this directory for changes
3. New and updated sessions are synced to OpenSync
4. Synced sessions appear in your dashboard within seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not syncing

1. Check status: `opencode-sync status`
2. Verify API key is valid in Settings
3. Check network connectivity

### Sessions missing

OpenCode may need to be restarted to flush session data.

### Permission errors

Ensure you have read access to `~/.opencode/sessions/`
