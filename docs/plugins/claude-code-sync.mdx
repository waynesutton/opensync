# Claude Code Plugin

Sync your Claude Code sessions to OpenSync automatically.

## Installation

Install the plugin globally:

```bash
npm install -g claude-code-sync
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn global add claude-code-sync
```

## Configuration

### Login

Connect the plugin to your OpenSync account:

```bash
claude-code-sync login
```

You'll be prompted for:

- **Convex URL** - Your OpenSync backend URL
- **API Key** - Your API key from Settings

### Config File

Configuration is stored in `~/.claude-code-sync/config.json`:

```json
{
  "convexUrl": "https://your-deployment.convex.cloud",
  "apiKey": "osk_..."
}
```

## Commands

### status

Check connection and sync status:

```bash
claude-code-sync status
```

Output:

```
Connected: true
Convex URL: https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
Sessions synced: 28
Last sync: 5 minutes ago
```

### sync

Manually trigger a sync:

```bash
claude-code-sync sync
```

<Info>
  Sessions sync automatically. Manual sync is useful after a network
  interruption.
</Info>

### logout

Disconnect and clear credentials:

```bash
claude-code-sync logout
```

## How Syncing Works

1. Claude Code stores sessions in `~/.claude/projects/`
2. The plugin monitors for new and updated sessions
3. Sessions sync to OpenSync in real-time
4. Each message includes model, tokens, and timestamp

## Session Data

Synced sessions include:

| Field    | Description                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| messages | Full conversation history    |
| model    | claude-3-5-sonnet, etc.      |
| tokens   | Prompt and completion tokens |
| cost     | Estimated cost               |
| project  | Project directory path       |

## Troubleshooting

### Sessions not appearing

1. Verify login: `claude-code-sync status`
2. Check Claude Code is writing to the expected directory
3. Try manual sync: `claude-code-sync sync`

### Duplicate sessions

This can happen if session IDs change. Contact support if duplicates persist.
