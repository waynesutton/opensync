# Context Search

Find relevant context from past sessions using semantic and full-text search.

## Search Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Full-Text Search" description="Match exact words and phrases" />
  <Card
    title="Semantic Search"
    description="Find similar concepts and meaning"
  />
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

### Full-Text Search

Matches exact terms in session content:

```
authentication middleware
```

Returns sessions containing "authentication" and "middleware".

### Semantic Search

Uses AI embeddings to find conceptually similar content:

```
how to handle user login
```

Returns sessions about authentication, even if they don't contain those exact words.

## Using Context Search

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Context">
    Click **Context** in the navigation menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your query">
    Type a question or keywords in the search box
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review results">
    Results show matching sessions ranked by relevance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy context">
    Click **Copy** to copy relevant context for use in prompts
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Access

Use the search API for programmatic access:

```bash
# Full-text search
curl -X POST "https://your-convex.convex.site/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "authentication", "type": "fulltext"}'

# Semantic search
curl -X POST "https://your-convex.convex.site/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "how to handle login", "type": "semantic"}'
```

## Use Cases

- **RAG pipelines** - Inject relevant context into prompts
- **Knowledge retrieval** - Find past solutions to similar problems
- **Documentation** - Search through coding conversations
- **Learning** - Review how you solved problems before

<Tip title="Combine with prompts">
  Use context search results to provide relevant background when starting new
  coding sessions.
